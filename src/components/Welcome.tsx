        <p>
          My name is Matheus Levi, I'm a back-end programmer living in Salvador,
          Bahia, Brazil.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although I have more knowledge and skill with the back-end, I can do
          simple tasks on the front-end (like this portfolio), with basic tools
          (HTML, CSS, JS) or frameworks (React, Vue, Angular).
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been programming since I was 12 years old, starting with Python,
          then progressing to JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C, C# and C++.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm always looking to develop my current knowledge and acquire new
          skills.
